# CS 493 Final Project

This is an application an API called Tarpaulin, a lightweight course management tool that’s an “alternative” to Canvas.  In particular, Tarpaulin allows users (instructors and students) to see information about the courses they’re teaching/taking.  It allows instructors to create assignments for their courses, and it allows students to submit solutions to those assignments.
The Tarpaulin API you implement must support all of the endpoints described in the Tarpaulin OpenAPI specification.  The GitHub repository for this project contains the Tarpaulin OpenAPI specification. 
This project is contributed by Bhavya Parikh, Susmita Padala and Umayal Annamalai.
